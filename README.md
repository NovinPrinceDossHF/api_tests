| Test Case ID | Test Name | Validation | Type of Validation | Reasoning |
|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
|Cat_Facts_001| test_get_single_fact_success| response.raise_for_status()|Error Handling / HTTP Status Code (implicit)| Automatically raises an HTTPError for 4xx (client error) or 5xx (server error) response status codes|
|Cat_Facts_001| test_get_single_fact_success| assert_status_code(response, 200) | HTTP Status Code | Fundamental check to ensure request was successfully processed |
|Cat_Facts_001| test_get_single_fact_success| assert_is_json(response) | Content Type / Response Format | Ensures that the response body is valid JSON |
|Cat_Facts_001| test_get_single_fact_success| assert isinstance(data, dict) | JSON Structure / Data Type |  APIs often return a JSON object (which maps to a Python dictionary) as their top-level structure for single entities. This confirms the expected overall structure |
|Cat_Facts_001| test_get_single_fact_success| assert expected_key in data | Content / Key Presence | This is a parameterized test that runs twice:It asserts that the fact key and length is present in the JSON response |
|Cat_Facts_002| test_fact_and_length_data_types | assert "fact" in data, assert "length" in data | Content / Key Presence | Ensures the presence of these critical fields before attempting to check their data types, preventing KeyError if they were missing |
|Cat_Facts_002| test_fact_and_length_data_types | assert isinstance(data["fact"], str) | Data Type | Validates that the value associated with the fact key is indeed a string. This is crucial for data integrity and ensuring that consumers of this API can expect a text-based fact |
|Cat_Facts_002| test_fact_and_length_data_types | assert isinstance(data["length"], int) | Data Type | Validates that the value associated with the length key is an integer. This is important for numerical operations or ensuring consistent data types for consumers |
|Cat_Facts_003| test_fact_length_matches_content | assert actual_fact_length == reported_length | Data Consistency / Business Logic | This is a crucial business logic validation. It checks that the length field reported by the API accurately reflects the actual length of the fact string. This ensures data integrity and that the API is providing consistent and correct information. If these two values don't match, it indicates a bug in the API's logic |
